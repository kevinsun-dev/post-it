# The Green Post-it

***The Green Post-it*** is a collection of quick sketches on green post-its by Kevin Sun. Nothing more, nothing less. Much like the simplicity of the sketches, the website it's hosted on is designed to load as little as possible, with `512 x 512` jpeg images loaded on command by the barebone `script.js`. It's made without loading in JQuery or Bootstrap, responsive on both mobile and desktop by way of the grid library in PureCSS. All scripts total under `6kb` with the rest of the loading cost taken up by the image itself and a Google Font.
